# Calculating the average volume

Just as we calculated the average radius we can also calculate the average volume using: 

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\overline{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i)

__To complete this exercise you must calculate the average volume using this formula.__

To get you started I have loaded the data from the file `bubbles.dat` into the NumPy array called `radii`.  The volumes of the bubbles should be calculated from the radii in this file.  The volumes you then obtain should be used for the ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=X_i) values in the above formulas.
